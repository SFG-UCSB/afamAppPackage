<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Step 2a – Summarize and Qualitatively Assess Any Existing Fisheries Management Controls</h2>
<p>As an important first step, summarize any existing fisheries management controls that may affect your site. If there are no existing FMCs, skip to Step 2b.</p>
<p>Qualitatively assess how existing fisheries management controls are performing. This will help determine whether or not these controls are appropriate, or if other or additional controls should be used instead. Think about the following considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Who mandates this FMC?</strong> Is it locally mandated (in which case it could potentially be modified or removed), or is it mandated by a higher body (such as a regional or national body – this may make the FMC more difficult to modify or remove)? This can help frame a discussion around whether or not this FMC could be modified or removed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What is the cost of this FMC?</strong> Does it require expensive data collection or enforcement?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What is the level of compliance with this FMC?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>What is public attitude towards this FMC?</strong> You may be able to use existing KAP survey data to help quantify this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Are current FMCs helping the fishery reach its goals?</strong> You may use Table A2. 2, Table A2. 3, and Table A2. 4 to see common goals of many FMCs and determine if the goals of your fishery are being met.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What are other implementation pros/cons</strong>?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Based on this qualitative assessment, you may be happy with the current set of FMCs in which case you can skip to Step 2c. Alternatively, if the FMCs are not performing as your community may wish, proceed to Step 2b to explore selecting different FMCs. Either way, you will quantitatively assess how well FMCs are doing in terms of fisheries performance in Step 5 by performing data-limited assessments using any available data. Based on this quantitative evaluation, you may wish to change FMCs during the next iteration of the AFAM cycle.</p>

<div id="step-2b-preliminary-selection-of-new-fisheries-management-controls" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Step 2b – Preliminary Selection of New Fisheries Management Controls</h2>
<p>Fisheries managers have a number of different fisheries management controls (FMCs) to choose from to manage their fishery goals. Many FMCs are designed with the primary objective of limiting fishing mortality such as catch limits; however, other FMCs are designed to protect certain biological or ecological functions in an ecosystem such as seasonal closures to protect spawning aggregations. Descriptions of commonly used FMCs are listed in <em>Table A2. 1</em>. This table also includes data requirements and enforcement considerations for the implementation of each FMC. Additionally, Appendix 7 – Fisheries Management Control Case Studies has case studies for each FMC that describe situations where the FMC has been implemented in a small-scale fishery. These case studies present some of the opportunities, challenges, and implications these different FMCs bring to small-scale fisheries.</p>
<p>To select a list of preliminary fisheries management controls, use the six questions in the decision tree below (Figure 3) as a general guide and first step to determine what FMCs may be appropriate for your fishery. However, conditions occurring in your specific fishery must be carefully considered as well as the community goals for your TURF-Reserve. Additionally, while this figure is one tool for helping select the type of FMC (i.e., minimum size limit) it does no provide guidance on the specific FMC that should be implemented (i.e., what that minimum size limit should be) Steps 2c and 2d are designed to guide additional considerations when determining appropriate and specific FMCs.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Step 2c – Consider Applying Additional Fisheries Management Controls to Better Meet Goals</h2>
<p>There is no prescriptive method for determining the ‘perfect’ combination of FMCs for every site because the most appropriate FMCs will greatly depend on the specific conditions and characteristics of the TURF-reserve and surrounding community. The following 6 steps, along with the information in in Table A2. 2, Table A2. 3, and Table A2. 4, can serve as a guide to help identify a set of FMCs that may be effective at meeting your site’s management goals.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Find the FMC(s) that were either existing (Step 2a) or newly selected (Step 2b) in Table A2. 2, Table A2. 3, and Table A2. 4. These tables describe potential negative or positive impacts of each FMC on common biological, ecological, and socioeconomic fishery management objectives.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify which of the management objectives in the first row of Table A2. 2, Table A2. 3, and Table A2. 4 align with the site’s management goals that were identified during the goal setting exercise of the FLAGS toolkit (or other goal setting activities your site has conducted).</p></li>
<li><p>Review the potential impact of each FMC being considered for your site on each of your management objectives.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine if the preliminary selection of FMC(s) will conflict with or fail to accomplish any of your site’s management goals. For example, a catch limit may have been identified as an appropriate FMC to control harvest at a site but additional management goals of the site may be to protect habitat and reduce bycatch. Table A2. 3 shows that implementing a catch limit may result in an increase in bycatch rates and increased habitat damage if implemented without any other FMCs.</p></li>
<li><p>Use Table A2. 2, Table A2. 3, and Table A2. 4 to identify FMC(s) that are associated with positive impacts on the sites management objectives. FMC(s) identified here can be chosen in combination with FMC(s) identified in Step 2a to meet multiple management objectives. For example, in some fisheries, combining gear restrictions with catch limits may be effective at controlling harvest, and reducing bycatch and habitat damage.</p></li>
<li><p>In Table A2. 2, Table A2. 3, and Table A2. 4, some FMCs have similar impacts across management objectives and it may be unclear which FMC is most appropriate for your site. To determine the most appropriate FMC(s) for your site, consider the “ease of implementation” for each FMC listed in Table A2. 1 and how it aligns with the specific conditions and characteristics the site.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="step-2d-consider-implications-with-relevant-stakeholders" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Step 2d – Consider Implications with Relevant Stakeholders</h2>
<p>Before finalizing which FMC(s)will be implemented at your site, consider how fishers (as well as other stakeholders such as middlemen, enforcement organizations, etc.) may respond to this management control by considering the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What management methods have successfully been implemented in the past?</p></li>
<li><p>Can this management method be effectively implemented and enforced?</p></li>
<li><p>Is this method socially and politically feasible, and will fishers comply with it?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The ability of the selected FMCs to meet the stated community objectives for the TURF-Reserve defined in the FLAGS toolkit should be discussed will all relevant stakeholders, along with any potential tradeoffs of implementing the selected FMC(s).</p>
<p>Additionally, prior to implementing FMC(s), any existing KAP and social Impact Survey data should be reviewed. KAP data can be used to provide insight into individual attitudes towards fishery management in your community. Social Impact Survey data can be used to provide context as to how dependent the community is on the fishery and how changes in FMCs may affect their livelihoods. Any information on enforcement should also be reviewed to gain a better understanding of the likelihood of compliance with implementation of new FMCs.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Step 2e – General Guidance for Setting Effective FMCs for the First Time</h2>
<p><strong><em>Note – This step is only applicable when developing your Adaptive Fisheries Assessment and Management Framework for the first time. In following years, you will use harvest control rules (defined later) to adaptively adjust these initial controls.</em></strong></p>
<p>Once you have finalized your list of FMCs that will be implemented in your community, you will need to define the specifics of the FMC for the first time. For example, what will your catch limit actually be? The specifics will depend on the status of your site’s resources, the population dynamics of the targeted species at the site, and your site’s specific management objectives. If you believe target species are depleted, if little information is available, and/or if enforcement or compliance is low, we recommend taking a precautionary approach using the following suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Catch Limit</strong> - Set annual catch limit at or below the previous year’s total catch</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bag or Trip Limit</strong> - Divide the previous year’s catch by the number of fishers participating in the fishery. Set the Bag or trip limit at that level or below</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Size limit</strong> - Set a minimum size limit above the minimum size at maturity. A maximum size limit may also be set to protect <em>megaspawners</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Temporal limits</strong> – Close the fishery during biologically sensitive times or during times (or areas) when the catchability of species greatly increases (such as Spawning aggregations).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vessel/gear restrictions</strong> - Gear and vessel restrictions should be set that minimize the impact of the fishery on habitat. Gear dimensions should also be set that reduce bycatch. For example, small mesh size in nets may be prohibited to reduce the landings of individuals below reproductive maturity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deployment Limits</strong> - Initial deployment limits may be set to restrict the number of gears being used to the same number of gears that were used in the previous year or below.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sex specific</strong> - Ban the take of females that are egg-bearing or the take of females during a biologically sensitive period.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Protection of Ecologically Important Species</strong> - Restrict fishing of specific species in order to protect key ecological function, such as herbivorous parrotfish that control macroalgae cover.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.10</span> Fisheries Management Control Case Studies</h2>
<p><strong><em>Please note: These examples do not necessarily come from TURF-Reserve systems, but are still indicative of how these fisheries management control approaches have been used in small-scale near shore tropical fisheries</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Catch Limits</strong></p>
<p>In the sea cucumber fishery in the Northern District of New Caledonia, fishermen noticed a decline in commercial sized sea cucumber known as sandfish (<em>Holothuria scabra</em>) in the early 2000s. After closing the fishery for a short period of time, they worked with the Fisheries Department in 2008 to set a total allowable catch (TAC) for the fishery, which they then allocated into quotas for individual fishermen. The TAC was set according to the total biomass of legally-sized adult sandfish, taking into account both abundance and body size. This harvestable biomass was calculated through sampling of the sandfish population and was re-assessed periodically. After implementing the TAC, there was an increase in total sandfish biomass and a 142% increase in the number of individuals. There was also an increase in the mean weight of sandfish and the density of individuals. Due to the increases in the sandfish population, the fishermen were able to raise the TAC in subsequent years. They also combined the use of the TAC with a cycle of open and closed periods of fishing.</p>

<p><strong>Bag/Trip Limits</strong></p>
<p>In the recreational gag <em>(Mycteroperca microlepis</em>) fishery in the Gulf of Mexico, bag limits are used to prevent recruitment overfishing. However, discard mortality rates reduce the efficiency of the fishery.</p>

<p><strong>Size Limits</strong></p>
<p>1. In Puerto Rico’s spiny lobster (<em>Panulirus argus</em>) fishery, landings, catch per unit effort, and average body size all increased from 1988-2001, potentially as a result of the implementation of a minimum size limit (Matos-Caraballo et al., 2007).</p>

<p>2. Belize’s queen conch fishery is managed by a variety of regulations, including a prohibition on fishing with scuba equipment, marine reserves that protect nursery, feeding, and mating grounds, a quota system, and a minimum size limit. The minimum size limit was introduced in 2000 and establishes a minimum shell length of 7 inches and a minimum weight of 3 ounces of partially processed meat. As a result of these regulations, conch landings increased from 1977 to 2011, as have average conch density and mean shell length. The minimum size was set based on the size at maturity.</p>

<p><strong>Temporal Limits</strong></p>
<p>1. On Ahus Island in Papua New Guinea, the community only allows fishing in six specific areas of their lagoon for a certain number of days each year. The locations of the restricted areas are dictated by tradition. Ecological surveys found that the biomass and average size of target species was much greater in the restricted areas than outside, and harvest days did not affect the overall stock.</p>

<p>2. In villages in Madang Province in Papua New Guinea and North Sulawesi, Indonesia, fishers periodically close areas to harvesting and then open them for specified periods of time. Areas managed with periodic closures have higher biomass and average body size of target fish species than unmanaged areas, and both long-lived and short-lived species benefit from periodic closures. Fishers are able to harvest fish for important events without depleting the stock in the periodically harvested areas.</p>

<p><strong>Gear/Vessel Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>In Ahus Island in Papua New Guinea, the community prohibits spear and net fishing in six areas of the reef lagoon, while line fishing is unregulated. A comparison of the reef ecosystem inside and outside of the areas with gear restrictions found that the areas where spear and net fishing were prohibited had 60% more biomass of fish. The individual fish were also larger and there was less discarded gear inside the restricted area. There was no significant difference in the overall fish abundance, species richness of fish, or coral cover and diversity.</p>

<p><strong>Deployment Limits</strong></p>
<p>In a lagoon fishery in Thua Thien Hue Province, Vietnam, fisheries organizations worked to reduce the fishing capacity by decreasing the number of fixed fishing gears present. The amount of fishing gear had previously been increasing without any control over the number and placement of traps and nets. In 2010, the fisheries organizations began a consensus-based process to determine gear reductions of traps and bottom nets in the lagoon.</p>

<p><strong>Sex-specific Controls</strong></p>
<p>The fisheries cooperatives in Baja California, Mexico have been successful at managing their resources sustainably, with increased landings of spiny lobster over the past forty years. Among other regulations, the cooperatives prohibit the capture of egg-bearing females, which contributes to the sustainability of the fishery.</p>

<p><strong>Seasonal Closures</strong></p>
<p>In 1990, the U.S. Virgin Islands Division of Fish and Wildlife and the Caribbean Fisheries Management Council instituted a seasonal closure of a red hind <em>(Epinephelus guttatus</em>) spawning aggregation south of St. Thomas, in response to declines in red hind abundance. A subsequent study in 1997 found increases in average length and abundance, as well as normalization of the sex ratio compared to before the creation of the seasonal closure.</p>

<p><strong>Protection of Ecologically Important Species</strong></p>
<p>In 2010, the government of Bonaire prohibited the harvest of parrotfish with the goal of protecting species that help maintain coral reef health. Parrotfish biomass declined from 2003-2011, but the rate of decline slowed after 2011. From 2011-2013, the density of parrotfish increased, likely in response to the fishing ban.</p>
