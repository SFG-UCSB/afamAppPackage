# Welcome to the Adaptive Fisheries Assessment and Management (AFAM) Toolkit Dashboard!

We've tried to make using the AFAM Toolkit Dashboard simple and intuitive. The dashboard follows the steps outlined in the AFAM Toolkit Guidance document, which you can find by clicking on the "Click for help!" link during each step. Proceed through each step of the dashboard, working left to right through the tabs at the top of the dashboard. Each tab has additional instructions. Once you have completed all steps, you can save a copy of your work during Step 8. This can then be used a basis for your fishery management plan.

We recommend that during each step you thoroughly read the help documentation, and any associated original references. This will help ensure you understand the assumptions and implications of using each type of data-limited assessment method contained in the toolkit, and use only methods appropriate for your fishery. This toolkit is not meant to be a substitute for more formal stock assessment and management, but rather can be seen as a stepping stone for places where management is currently guided with little or no scientific information.  

This toolkit was developed by the Fish Forever partnership, but can hopefully serve the broader fisheries management and marine conservation community. Please contact Gavin McDonald with any questions, comments, or feedback (gmcdonald@bren.ucsb.edu).
