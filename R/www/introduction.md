# Welcome to the Adaptive Fisheries Assessment and Management (AFAM) Toolkit Dashboard!

We've tried to make using the AFAM Toolkit Dashboard simple and intuitive. The dashboard follows the steps outlined in the <a href="_book/welcome.html" target="_blank">AFAM Toolkit guidance document</a>. Proceed through each step of the dashboard, working left to right through the tabs at the top of the dashboard. Each tab has additional instructions. You can also click the "Click for help!" button during each step for a link to the relevant section of the <a href="_book/welcome.html" target="_blank">AFAM Toolkit guidance document</a>. Once you have completed all steps, you can save a copy of your work during Step 8. This can then be used a basis for your fishery management plan.


This toolkit was developed by the Fish Forever partnership, but can hopefully serve the broader fisheries management and marine conservation community. Please contact Gavin McDonald with any questions, comments, or feedback (gmcdonald@bren.ucsb.edu).
