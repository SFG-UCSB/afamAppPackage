# Step 4 – Define Harvest Control Rules

*How should FMCs be adjusted according to the performance indicators of
the fishery?*

![](myMediaFolder/media/Step4.png)

*Harvest Control Rules (HCRs)* will be used to adjust FMCs according to
where the fishery’s performance indicators fall relative to their
reference points. The HCR may specify some combination of adjustments to
the FMCs that is expected to move the performance indicator towards the
target reference point, and away from the *limit reference point***,**
therefore improving the performance of the fishery. While we provide
guidance to define HCRs, it should be noted that HCRs should be based on
realistic compliance and enforcement concerns and address community
goals for your TURF-Reserve (more guidance is provided in Step 4b).

It is important for stakeholders and managers to agree on the suite of
HCRs in a safe and neutral setting before any management decisions need
to be made. This can help improve compliance by ensuring management
responses are objective, consistent, transparent, and appropriate.
Therefore, it is important to identify all foreseeable possible
scenarios that could occur in the fishery and create corresponding HCRs
for each scenario.

## Step 4a – Define General Harvest Control Rules for All Possible Interpretations

During this step, you will define general harvest control rules (for
example, if the performance indicator is below the target reference
point, reduce the total allowable catch). In the following step, you
will add specificity to your harvest control rules (for example, if the
performance indicator is 20% below the target reference point, reduce
the total allowable catch by 20%). It is important that you define a HCR
for every foreseeable interpretation so that management responses can be
transparent and objective when the time comes to implement them.

Use *Table A4. 1*, *Table A4. 2*, and *Table A4. 3* as the framework for
defining your general HCRs. The three tables contain the performance
indicators that are associated with each tier and suggest HCRs from the
literature. For each performance indicator and assessment result, the
table lists a number of potential interpretations and corresponding
HCRs. This table provides some examples, but is by no means
comprehensive or prescriptive – it is illustrative only. During this
step, fill out Table A1. 5 using the provided HCRs that you feel are
relevant to your fishery, as well as any other foreseeable
interpretations and HCRs that you think should be put in place.

Each row also has a traffic light indicator that describes if a
management response is necessary:

-   Green indicates that either no management response is
    necessary, or management could be even less restrictive.

-   Yellow indicates that a precautionary or more restrictive
    management response should be implemented.

-   Red indicates that the fishery should be closed and a
    fishery recovery plan implemented.

## Step 4b – Add Specificity to Harvest Control Rules

During this step, you will add specificity to your HCRs (for example, if
the performance indicator is 20% below the target reference point,
reduce the total allowable catch by 20%). Be as specific as possible
when defining the magnitude to which FMCs should be adjusted given the
fishery’s performance indicator.

The magnitude that a HCR should adjust your FMC(s) will depend on:

1.  Productivity (life history) of the target species

    a.  Productivity of key target species is an output of the FLAGS
        toolkit. This information may either come from a PSA result or a
        more data-limited qualitative approach for assessing species
        productivity.

    b.  Species with low productivity will require higher, more
        restrictive levels of response when changes are necessary;
        species with higher productivity will require lower levels of
        response when changes are necessary

2.  Likelihood of compliance

3.  Social and political feasibility

4.  Enforcement capacity

5.  Level of uncertainty with data and the estimation of performance
    indicators,

    a.  The more uncertain you are, the more precautionary you may want
        to make your management

6.  Risk tolerance.

    a.  Communities with higher risk tolerance may choose to be more
        lenient when choosing HCRs, while communities with lower risk
        tolerance may choose more restrictive HCRs to be more
        precautionary in the face of changing and uncertain conditions.

You should consult any existing KAP and Social Impact Survey data when
setting HCRs. KAP data will provide an indication as to individual
attitudes towards fishery management in your community. Social Impact
Survey data will provide context as to how dependent the community is on
the fishery and how changes in fisheries management controls may affect
their livelihoods. Additionally, any existing enforcement data should be
consulted to gain a better sense for the likelihood of compliance with
any new regulations.

You should also consider the size of the NTZ and TURF when setting HCRs.
Sites with a small NTZ relative to the size of the TURF may wish the
exercise more precaution by setting more restrictive HCRs (i.e., if
indicators are interpreted to mean poor fisheries performance, make more
drastic adjustments to the FMCs). Sites with an NTZ that is not placed
explicitly in areas that protect critical habitat may also wish to
exercise more precaution with stricter HCRs. Sites with larger NTZs that
protect a significant portion of critical habitat could be more lenient
in their HCRs. Often, large and well-placed NTZs can act as a buffer
against uncertainty and variability. By completely restricting access to
a certain portion of the stock, marine reserves are analogous to an
emergency savings account. Protecting a fraction of a fish stock in
reserves reduces the risk of overfishing and the chance of stock
collapse in the long term. Displaced fishing effort and unintended
consequences resulting after implementation of a reserve can be
mitigated when effective FMCs are in place outside of the reserve. When
harvest levels are appropriately controlled a spillover of biomass from
marine reserves to the adjacent fishery may occur that can benefit
fisheries.
