# Step 3 – Select Performance Indicators, Reference Points, and Assessment Methods

*What is the best way to determine the status of the fishery?*

![](myMediaFolder/media/Step3.png)

Steps 3a through 3c will guide you through selecting appropriate
performance indicators, reference points, and assessment methods for
your fishery.

While we provide best practices in these steps, it should be noted that
performance indicators and reference points are not one-size-fits-all.
They should be based on community goals for your TURF-Reserve. While
setting performance indicators and reference points, consult the goals
that were prioritized during the FLAGS toolkit or other goal-setting
exercises. For example, if increased landings for food provision is a
goal, you may wish to use landings as one of your performance indicators
and upward trends in landings as a reference point. If conservation of
biomass in the water for dive tourism is a goal, you may wish to use
fished:unfished density ratio as one of your performance indicators and
a high fished:unfished density ratio as your target reference point.

## Step 3a – Select Performance Indicators 

Using Table A3. 1, select appropriate performance indicators for your
fishery. Depending on the assessment and management tier your fishery
falls under, there will be a number of options for the indicators you
may choose to select. Whenever possible, we recommend that multiple
indicators are chosen from multiple independent data streams. This will
reduce the uncertainty associated with any single data stream and will
paint a more complete picture of the fishery. Use the specific guidance
below for your tier.

**Tier 1 – Precautionary Assessment and Management (for new FF sites
with less than one year of data)**

Even though limited data will be available for a Tier 1 fishery,
managers can still perform a basic qualitative fisheries assessment
using local ecological knowledge about the fishery, such as the types of
fishing gear that are currently used, changes in the fishing seasons
that have been observed over time, and changes in species composition of
landings over time. Potential performance indicators for Tier 1 are
provided in *Appendix 3 – Selecting your performance indicators,
reference points, and assessment methods*, along with pros, cons, and
the types of species each indicator is appropriate for.

At a minimum, we recommended using the following performance indicators
for Tier 1:

-   At least one indicator based on qualitative fisheries
    characterization

-   If available, at least one fishery-independent indicator based on
    underwater visual survey or experimental fishing

**Tier 2 – Preliminary Adaptive Assessment and Management (for FF sites
with one year of data)**

Data streams in Tier 2 include those under Tier 1, as well as at least
one year of fishery-dependent data that may come from a combination of
Catch Reporting, Boat-intercept Surveys, and Fishery Dependent
Length-composition Surveys. Potential performance indicators for Tier 2
are provided in *in Appendix 3 – Selecting your performance indicators,
reference points, and assessment methods*, along with pros, cons, and
the types of species each indicator is appropriate for.

At a minimum, we recommended using the following performance indicators
for Tier 2:

-   All indicators from Tier 1

-   At least one indicator based on fishery-dependent length-composition
    survey

**Tier 3 – Multi-Indicator framework for Adaptive Assessment and
Management (for sites with more than one year of data)**

Tier 3 sites will have a time series of data available that can be used
to examine trends in multiple performance indicators in addition to
information and data described under Tiers 1 and 2. Potential Tier 3
performance indicators for each available data stream type or toolkit
output are provided in *Appendix 3 – Selecting your performance
indicators, reference points, and assessment methods*, along with pros,
cons, and the types of species each indicator is appropriate for.

At a minimum, we recommended using the following performance indicators
for Tier 3:

-   All indicators from Tier 2

-   At least one trend-based indicator that uses a time series of
    landings or CPUE data

## Step 3b – Select Reference Points

During this step, select reference points for each of your chosen
performance indicators. *Appendix 3 – Selecting your performance
indicators, reference points, and assessment methods* offers suggestions
for generic reference points from the literature that may be appropriate
for each performance indicator.

For every performance indicator, select both a target reference point
(TRP) as well as a limit reference point (LRP). A target reference point
is a numerical value (or trend) that indicates that the performance of
the fishery is at a desirable level; often management is geared towards
achieving or maintaining this target. This target could be a static
value chosen from the literature, or a trend in historic data (for
example, a target may be that the indicator is higher than a historic
running average). A limit reference point is a numerical value that
indicates that the performance of the fishery is unacceptable (*e.g*.,
severely overfished), and that management action should be taken to
improve fishery performance or population levels. Similarly, these
values may come from the literature or historic data.

When selecting reference points, we recommend the following best
practices:

-   For reference points of length-based indicators and of
    fishery-independent-based indicators, we recommend using
    literature-based reference points

-   Whenever using reference points from literature, use reference
    points from studies of comparable species and geographic locations.

-   For CPUE- and landings-based indicators, we recommend using a time
    series of data to generate reference points that are based on trends
    or running averages.

-   If local or international scientists are available for consultation,
    discuss reference points with them to determine if they are
    appropriate for your fishery and adjust values as necessary.

## Step 3c – Select Assessment Methods

During this step, select the appropriate assessment method for each of
your chosen performance indicators. *Appendix 3 – Selecting your
performance indicators, reference points, and assessment methods*
outlines these options. Most performance indicators have only one
associated assessment method; however, the performance indicator of
fishing mortality has several options. Refer to *Appendix 5 – Assessment
Method Descriptions* for more details about each specific assessment
method including inputs, outputs, and caveats.

# Appendix 5 – Assessment Method Descriptions

***Fishery Independent-Data***

***Coral Reef Thresholds***

-   **Description**: This method uses the ratio of total fish biomass
    inside a no-take-zone (NTZ) to the total fish biomass outside the
    NTZ. For some ecosystems, including coral reefs, recent studies show
    the existence of quantitative thresholds associated with fish
    densities (measured in kg/ha). Below these thresholds, ecosystems
    change from desirable (e.g., high coral cover) to less desirable
    states (e.g., dominated by algae) that produce fewer ecosystem
    services. Fisheries in ecosystems with documented fishing thresholds
    can be managed to remain above these limits, reducing the risk of
    system collapse. At the moment, thresholds have been documented for
    coral reefs in the Indian Ocean (McClanahan et al. 2011) and the
    Caribbean Sea (Karr et al. 2014). Biomass of fished populations and
    unfished populations can be measured with experimental fishing or
    visual surveys, and the resulting ratio of biomass from these
    surveys can then be compared to the threshold limits. Comparing this
    ratio to a target ratio defined in Karr et al. 2015, fishing
    pressure can be adjusted accordingly to maintain the fish biomass
    outside of a NTZ above the 0.5 *B~MSY~* (Biomass maximum
    multi-species sustainable yield) target.

**Inputs:**

-   Estimate of total fish biomass inside and outside of NTZ

**Outputs:**

-   Ratio of fish biomass outside the NTZ to the biomass inside the NTZ

**How this can be used by management:**

-   Integrates many species into an ecosystem community metric

-   Provides a reference direction of overall fishing mortality for all
    species

-   Provides precautionary estimate of current status of ecosystem that
    supports the fishery

**Input Sensitivities:**

-   Assumes no-take reserves are representative of historical, unfished
    biomass

**Caveats:**

-   This method assumes that a fully-functioning and well-enforced NTZ
    has been sited appropriately with representative habitat inside and
    outside of the NTZ, and been in place long enough for the population
    living inside the NTZ to be a proxy for an un-fished population.

***Fished:Unfished Density Ratio (DR)***

**Description:** The DR uses fishery-independent data comparing ratios
of density, average length density of a specific life stage (immature,
mature adults, optimal size or mega-spawners), or CPUE outside to inside
of no-take zones (NTZs). Babcock & MacCall (2011) provide a clear
analysis of the use of density ratio (DR) assessment methods. The DR’s
control rule adjusts fishing pressure according to the distance of the
ratio of density outside to inside of the NTZ from a pre-specified
target ratio. One drawback of the density ratio is that in situations
where populations inside and outside the reserves both crash, the ratio
would remain the same and indicate that fishing can commence. In the DR
analysis, we modified the DR control rule to account for this dynamic.
The adjustment is scaled by the overall health of the population inside
the NTZ, measured as the density inside of the NTZ relative to the
historic maximum density recorded in the NTZ.

**Inputs: **

-   Density (or length by species) data inside and outside the NTZ
    (preferably collected in the same manner)

-   Historical maximum density inside the NTZ

**Outputs: **

-   Ratio of fish density outside the NTZ to the density inside the NTZ

**How this can be used by management:**

-   Stakeholders set a management target DR

-   This DR target ratio is compared to the ratio from assessment

-   Effort is adjusted based on how far apart these values are

**Input Sensitivities: **

-   Assumes historical maximum density inside the NTZ

**Caveats:**

-   This method assumes that a fully-functioning and well-enforced NTZ
    has been sited appropriately with representative habitat inside and
    outside of the NTZ, and has been in place long enough for the
    population living inside the NTZ to be a proxy for an un-fished
    population.

    -   *Implication*: May be less accurate for highly-mobile species
        that do not remain exclusively inside the NTZ such as snapper,
        tuna and mackerel.

-   Time trends in this data can be difficult to interpret if densities
    inside the MPA are changing rapidly

***No-take zone catch-curve (Catch Curve)***

**Description:** This method utilizes length-frequency data (fish
lengths) from inside and outside a NTZ to compare the slope of the
right-hand side of the log transformed age-frequency histogram from
inside the NTZ (an estimate of natural mortality (*M*)) to the slope of
the log transformed age-frequency histogram outside the NTZ (an estimate
of total mortality (*Z*)). Fishing mortality (*F*) can then be
calculated based on the difference between these two (*F* = *Z* – *M*).

**Inputs:**

-   Length-frequency data inside and outside NTZ (preferably collected
    in the same manner)

-   Life history parameters (growth parameters)

-   How many years the NTZ has been established and well-enforced

-   Information on the sizes of fish preferred by the fishery

**Outputs**

-   An estimate of fishing mortality (*F*)

**How this can be used by management :**

-   Stakeholders set management target F/M based on community objectives
    and thresholds of risk

-   Target *F*/*M* is compared with *F*/*M* from assessment

-   Effort is adjusted through harvest control rules based on how far
    apart these values are

**Input Sensitivities: **

-   Accuracy of individual fish length measurements

-   Accuracy of length-at-age relationships (*Von Bertanalffy growth
    parameters*

-   Correcting fitting of the curve (sensitive to estimates of NTZ age,
    preferred fish size)

**Caveats**:

-   This method assumes that a NTZ has been sited appropriately,
    well-enforced, and been in place long enough for the population
    living inside the NTZ to be a proxy for an un-fished population

    -   *Implication*: May be less accurate for highly-mobile species
        that do not remain exclusively inside the NTZ, such as snapper,
        tuna and mackerel

-   This method depends on reliably tracking population size structure
    changes, thus may be less accurate with small, fast-growing species

***Fishery-Dependent Data***

***Trends Analyses***

**Description:** This method uses catch data to compare total catch,
average catch, CPUE, and/or abundance between years of interests.
Comparisons can be derived for sequential years, or as a running average
between historical trends. Additionally, comparisons can be made across
all species or by species of interest.

**Inputs:**

-   Total catch for more than one year

-   Catch-Per-Unit-Effort (CPUE) for more than one year

-   Abundance of the catch for more than one year

-   Length-frequency of the catch for more than one year

**Outputs:**

-   Total catch and trends in total catch

-   CPUE and trends in CPUE

-   Abundance and trends in abundance

-   Average length and trends in average length

**How this can be used by management:**

-   Catch trends can support the interpretation of other analyses, for
    example of fishing morality of spawning potential ratio (SPR).

-   Understanding how the trends in catch fluctuate from one year to
    next or in comparison to the historic trends is essential to use
    catch trends for management.

**Input Sensitivities:**

-   It can be difficult to attribute a change in catch to a
    corresponding increase or decrease in biomass. Therefore, seeing an
    increase in catch could provide a false sense of security. Inferring
    stock status from catch statistics

**Caveats:**

-   This method depends on reliably tracking the total catch

-   For example, raw CPUE is seldom proportional to abundance over a
    > whole exploitation history and an entire geographic range, because
    > numerous factors affect catch rates.

***Catch Curve***

**Description:** This method utilizes length-frequency data (fish
lengths) to estimate the fishing mortality affecting the fished
population. Total fishing mortality (*Z*) is estimated using the slope
of the log transformed age-frequency histogram. Fishing mortality can
then be calculated based on the difference between total fishing
mortality and natural mortality (*F* = *Z* – *M*). Estimates of *M* can
come from the literature.

**Inputs:**

-   Length-frequency data

-   Life history parameters (growth parameters)

**Outputs: **

-   An estimate of fishing mortality

**How this can be used by management:**

-   Stakeholders set management target *F*/*M* based on community
    objectives and thresholds of risk

-   Target *F*/*M* is compared with *F*/*M* from assessment

-   Effort is adjusted through harvest control rules based on how far
    apart these values are

**Input Sensitivities: **

-   Accuracy of individual fish length measurements

-   Accuracy of length-at-age relationships (Von Bertalanffy growth
    parameters)

-   Correcting fitting of the curve (i.e., preferred fish size)

**Caveats:**

-   This method depends on reliably tracking population size structure
    > changes, thus may be less accurate for small, fast-growing species

***Froese Sustainability Indicators***

**Description:** This method uses the length-frequency of the catch to
estimate the distribution of life stages in the catch (Froese 2004).

**Inputs: **

-   Length-frequency of the catch

-   Length at maturity

**Outputs: **

-   Three metrics of fisheries sustainability:

    -   \(i) percentage of mature fish in catch, with 100% as target;

    -   \(ii) percent of specimens with optimum length in catch (*L~opt~*), with
        100% as target;

    -   and (iii) percentage of ‘mega-spawners’ in catch

**How this can be used by management:**

-   By fishing at *L~opt~* or the “spawn-at-least-once” principle in
    > conjunction with the protection of *megaspawners*, sustainability
    > of the fishery can be maintained.

**Input Sensitivities:**

-   Accuracy of individual fish length measurements

-   Accuracy of length at maturity

-   Selectivity

**Caveats:**

-   This method depends on reliably tracking population size structure
    > changes

    -   Implication: May be less accurate with small, fast-growing
        > species

## 

***Mean Length (L~bar~)***

**Description:** This method uses fishery-dependent or independent
length-frequency data. *L~bar~* uses the minimum and maximum fished
sizes, and the average length of the fish within the fished sizes from a
fished population, along with growth parameters. In the Ault et al. 2005
model, *L~bar~* provides an estimate of fishing mortality (*F*) that can
be compared to an estimate of natural mortality (*M*). Intuitively,
increasing fishing pressure will often cause decreasing average length.

**Inputs: **

-   Fishery-dependent or fishery-independent length-frequency data of
    fished population

-   Life history parameters, growth parameters, and natural mortality
    (*M*)

-   Information on the sizes of fish preferred by the fishery

**Outputs**:

-   An estimate of fishing mortality (*F*)

**How this can be used by management:**

-   Stakeholders set management target *F*/*M* based on community
    objectives and thresholds of risk

-   Target *F*/*M* is compared with *F*/*M* from assessment

-   Effort is adjusted based on how far apart *F*/*M* from the
    assessment is from the *F*/*M*

**Input Sensitivities: **

-   Estimate of *M* and growth parameters

-   Accuracy of individual fish length measurements

**Caveats: **

-   This method depends on reliably tracking population size structure
    > changes

    -   Implication: May be less accurate with small, fast-growing
        > species

-   *M* is assumed to be known, which often it is not

-   Assumes equilibrium

-   This model is less reliable when mean fish length is very low

***Mean Weight***

**Description:** This method can use fishery-dependent or independent
weight-frequency data to estimate fishing mortality (*F*) when no size
structure data is available. This method requires the von Bertalanffy
growth function, as well as the length-weight relationship and the
natural mortality (*M*). In this method, we construct a
Yield-Per-Recruit (YPR) model, which allows us to estimate the
theoretical age and weight structure of the population at any size.
Similar to Mean Length (*L~bar~*), Mean Weight provides an estimate of
*F* that can be compared to an estimate of *M*. Intuitively, increasing
fishing pressure will often cause decreasing average weight and/ or
length.

**Inputs: **

-   Fishery-dependent or fishery-independent weight-frequency data

-   Life history parameters, growth parameters, natural mortality (*M*)

-   Information on the sizes of fish preferred by the fishery

**Outputs**:

-   An estimate of fishing mortality (*F*)

**How this can be used by management: **

-   Stakeholders set management target *F*/*M* based on community
    objectives and thresholds of risk

-   Target *F*/*M* is compared with *F*/*M* from assessment

-   Effort is adjusted based on how far apart these values are

**Input Sensitivities: **

-   Estimate of *M* and growth parameters

-   Accuracy of individual fish weight measurements

-   Accuracy of length-weight relationship

**Caveats: **

-   This method depends on reliably tracking population size structure
    changes

    -   Implication: May be less accurate for small, fast-growing
        species

-   *M* is assumed to be known, which often it is not

-   Assumes equilibrium

-   This model is less reliable when mean fish weight is very low

***Bounded mean length mortality estimator***

**Description:** A modification of the Mean Length (*L~bar~*) method
(Ehrhardt et al. 1992). Does not assume that fishing mortality has been
constant over the life span of the fish being assessed, it takes into
account the time since a management change, and restricts the data used
for this analysis to those fish which have recruited to the fishery
during this time period.

**Inputs:**

-   Length-frequency of the catch, since management change

-   Mean asymptotic length (cm) of the von Bertalanffy growth equation

-   *L~λ~*, the age at *L~c~* (using the von Bertalanffy equation) and
    adding the number of years since a known harvest rate policy change,
    then converting back to length

-   *L~bar~* is the mean length of fish between *L~c~* and *L~λ~*.

**Outputs:**

-   An estimate of fishing mortality (*F*)

**How this can be used by management: **

-   Stakeholders set management target *F*/*M* based on community
    objectives and thresholds of risk

-   Target *F*/*M* is compared with *F*/*M* from assessment

-   Effort is adjusted based on how far apart these values are

**Input Sensitivities: **

-   Estimate of *M* and growth parameters

-   Accuracy of individual fish length measurements

**Caveats: **

-   This method depends on reliably tracking population size structure
    changes

    -   Implication: May be less accurate for small, fast-growing
        species

-   *M* is assumed to be known, which often it is not

-   Assumes equilibrium

-   This model is less reliable when mean fish length is very low

***Length-based Spawning Potential Ratio (SBSPR)***

**Description:** Length-based Pawning Potential Ratio (SBSPR) method
uses length-frequency data from a fished population to calculate the
spawning potential ratio (SPR) of a fishery (Hordyk et al. 2014). This
method is based on the concept that the equilibrium unfished size
structure of a population depends on the average maximum size attained
and the ratio of the rate of natural mortality (*M*) to the individual
growth rate (*K*; Prince et al. 2014). SPR is a measure of current egg
production relative to maximum possible production at un-fished levels.
Un-fished egg production is estimated using the natural mortality (*M*),
Von Bertanaffy (*VBK*) growth parameters, age at first maturity, and
fecundity at age. The fished SPR is calculated using the same
parameters, along with estimates of the fishing mortality rate (*F*),
and the sizes of fish selected by the fishery. By comparing the
estimated current SPR with a target SPR defined by stakeholders, a
harvest control rule can be used to adjust fisheries management controls
accordingly.

**Inputs**:

-   Length-frequency data from a fished population

<!-- -->

-   Gear selectivity

-   Life history parameters (fecundity, *VBK* parameters, natural
    mortality, age-at-maturity, length at age relationships)

**Outputs:**

-   SPR of target species

**How this can be used by management: **

-   Stakeholders set management target SPR

-   Target SPR is compared to SPR from assessment

-   Effort is adjusted based on how far apart these values are

**Input Sensitivities: **

-   Accuracy of individual fish length measurements

-   Representativeness of the length data

-   Accuracy of life history information, particularly growth and
    maturity parameters

**Caveats:**

-   This method is dependent on reliably tracking changes in population
    size structure

    -   *Implication*: May be less accurate for small, fast-growing
        species, such as surgeonfish, scad and spinefoot rabbit fish

-   Assumes the fishery is equilibrium and that conditions are
    relatively stable (environmental conditions, fishing pressure, stock
    status, etc.)

-   This method is less accurate if fishing pressures has been changing
    dramatically year to year

-   This method is less effective for species with highly variable
    recruitment (addition of juveniles to the population) such as
    lobster
