# Step 8 – Complete Your Fishery Management Plan

*How do I take the outputs of the AFAM toolkit to create a concrete
Fishery Management Plan?*

![](myMediaFolder/media/Step8.png)

We have provided a template Fishery Management Plan in Appendix 9 –
Fishery Management Plan Template. To complete this template, we
recommend you use the outputs of the AFAM Dashboard. You may also use
outputs from the FLAGS toolkit, the TURF-Reserve Design Survey, Site
Level Research Plan, Global Monitoring and Evaluation Plan, and Data
Collection Manual to fill out sections of this template. We recommend
you complete a fishery management plan for each species to be managed.
Note that the template provided here may need to be adapted to better
suit your regional context.

# Appendix 9 – Fishery Management Plan Template

-   **Fishery Overview:**

    ***You may use the outputs of the TURF-Reserve Design Survey and
    FLAGS toolkit to help complete this section.***

    -   **Location of the Fishery**: Country, state, city, management
        zone (if applicable).

    -   **History**: Provide a brief history of the fishery.

    -   **Type(s) of Fishery**: Commercial, recreational, etc. and
        whether near shore, off shore, or mixed.

    -   **Participants**: Number of fishers, number of vessels, number
        of communities (if applicable), and spatial distribution of
        participants/ communities.

    -   **Fishery Characteristics**: Describe the gear types utilized in
        the fishery (i.e. fixed gear, mobile gear, etc), including
        numbers for each if possible, as well as the general timeframe
        (i.e. season) of when the fishery occurs.

    -   **Management Characteristics**: Type of method currently used to
        manage the fishery (i.e. seasons, catch limits, size limits,
        effort limits, etc.). Also describe the general management
        decision-making process.

    -   **Governance**: Briefly describe key legislation and
        regulations, as well as types of committees and/or legislative
        land claims which are part of the decision making process (based
        on zones, areas, regions, international considerations).

    -   **Economic, Social, and Cultural Importance of the Fishery**:
        Provide a brief overview of economic conditions and social,
        cultural and economic issues.

    -   **Species Characteristics**: Provide a brief overview outlining
        the main biological characteristics of the species with emphasis
        on the aspects which impact on management of the species.
        Factors to be covered include range (both globally and locally),
        populations/stock structure, habitat requirements (including key
        location where applicable), migration routes and reproductive
        characteristics (i.e. season, behavior, fecundity, growth rates,
        spawning grounds).

    -   **Ecosystem Interactions**: Briefly describe interactions with
        other species and the physical environment. Where the
        information is available briefly describe the effect of climate
        regime changes on stock status, particularly recruitment and
        stock productivity.

-   **Fisheries Objectives and Challenges:**

***You may use the outputs of the FLAGS toolkit to help complete this
section.***

-   **Management Objectives**: Clearly state long-term objectives for
    fishery management under the following potential headings:

    -   **Yield/ Economic**

    -   **Stock Conservation**

    -   **Ecosystem **

    -   **Social and Cultural**

    -   **Compliance**

        -   For each long-term objective, outline short-term objectives
            specific for the duration of the plan.

-   **List all Trade-Offs Associated with these Objectives**: Provide a
    brief explanation of which objectives conflict with each other, such
    that one objective may have to be sacrificed to achieve another.
    Where possible, discuss potential management modifications that may
    lessen these trade-offs.

-   **Current Management Issues**: Provide an overview of current issues
    in the fishery, including those related to the target species, as
    well as by-catch and ecosystem concerns. Potential examples of
    management issues include:

    -   ***Fisheries Issues*** such as conflicts between gear sectors,
        catch monitoring, by-catch problems and other resource user
        issues.

    -   ***Depleted Species Concerns***, including species listed under
        CITES, and/ or any local endangered/threatened species
        legislation. Reference existing recovery strategies/management
        plans where appropriate.

    -   ***Oceans and Habitat Considerations***, including habitat
        impacts and discussions of ecologically significant areas that
        have been identified and documented within the geographic range
        of the fishery (including marine protected areas (MPAs) or
        no-take zones. Where information is available on the effect of
        climate regime change on stock status, it should be considered
        when developing harvest decision rules and other management
        measures. Any management measures in place to control aquatic
        invasive species should also be included.

    -   ***Gear Impacts***, including losses and resulting impacts.

    -   ***International Issues***
