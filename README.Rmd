list.of.packages <- c("tidyverse", "gridExtra", "pander", "shiny", "DT","devtools")
new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages) > 0 ) install.packages(new.packages)

## Load packages required for AFAM
lapply(list.of.packages, require, character.only = TRUE)

## Install AFAM from Github, an online file-sharing service
